# React Employee Directory

#### User's Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

#### Purpose

* Using React to build an employee directory with search bar as well as descend/ascend order filter that allows users to have an easier and faster access to each of their employees' information.

#### Functionality

* Learning and adapting to the new structures and syntaxes of React. A better understanding of React allows users to be more organize with their works and it is much more convenience since it allows users to code both HTML and JS within one file. ReactJS helps to prevent updating of DOM, which allows the apps will be faster and deliver better UX.
